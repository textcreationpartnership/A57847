            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For to you, the happy children of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I may ≈øay with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church of <hi>Ephe≈øus, Eph.</hi> 2.19. <hi>You are no more ≈øtrangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the hou≈øhold of God: and are built upon the foundation of the Apo≈øtles and Prophets, Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf being the chief corner-≈øtone.</hi> Wherefore to de≈øcribe to you the Antichri≈øtian Edifice, is no new di≈øcovery, a needle≈øs endeavour; and another labour were more opportune, to wit, <hi>to build on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already laid,</hi> if not the <hi>Gold, Silver,</hi> or <hi>Pretious Stones</hi> of <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas;</hi> at lea≈øt ≈øome work of edificatory doctrine <hi>which might abide and receive a reward,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. Yet my pre≈øent ≈øubject is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and nece≈ø≈øary; for, having lately left the <hi>Roman Chair</hi> for the <hi>Engli≈øh Church,</hi> I am debtor to both. To the one I owe a Chri≈øtian adieu, to the other an account of my peaceable ingre≈øs. And indeed, before I accu≈øe the <hi>Romi≈øh Cau≈øe,</hi> I profe≈øs ≈øeriou≈øly and candidly with St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.1. <hi>My hearts de≈øire and prayer to God for</hi> Rome <hi>is, that they may be ≈øaved; for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge. For being ignorant</hi> of Chri≈øts Go≈øpel, <hi>and going about to e≈øtabli≈øh</hi> a Go≈øpel <hi>of their own, they have not ≈øubmitted them≈øelves</hi> to the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt. Wherefore, a di≈øpen≈øation of the Go≈øpel being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52857:4"/>
committed to me, what I do, I do for the Go≈øpels ≈øake, <hi>for I am not a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt,</hi> God forbid, <hi>for it is the power of God, Rom.</hi> 1.16. able to ju≈øtifie its Preacher, fir≈øt ju≈øtified in its ≈øelf. To this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical de≈øign four things concur ob≈øervable in the Text; to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Go≈øpel St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, was the true Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, and therefore the only Go≈øpel to be preached.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As no other Go≈øpel is true, but this of Chri≈øt, preached by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> ≈øo, no Apo≈øtle or Angel, much le≈øs any Pope, ought to impo≈øe upon the Church of God, or preach to it any other Go≈øpel. If he do, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath given him his doom, <hi>Let him be accur≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> doth impo≈øe, and preach, or cau≈øe to be preached, ≈øuch a Go≈øpel as ≈øhall de≈øerve that <hi>Anathema,</hi> is next to be inquired into</p>
            <p n="4">4. If upon our di≈øqui≈øition it plainly appear, that the Pope doth impo≈øe upon all his ≈øubjects that <hi>P≈øeudo-evangelium,</hi> contrary to the received Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, then am I ju≈øtified for de≈øerting the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> where I could not remain without being accur≈øed.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe points declares the unity of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, to wit, as there is but <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Bapti≈øm, Eph.</hi> 4.5. ≈øo there is but one Go≈øpel of this our Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, of his Faith and Bapti≈øm. And in this point there is no controver≈øie.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond point declares the immutability and unchangeablene≈øs of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, that is, the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt hath ≈øuch a foundation of eternal, immutable, and impregnable Truth and Holine≈øs, that no creature in Heaven or Earth, can, or may pre≈øume to alter, violate, change, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli≈øh it, or to lay any other foundation of his own. Wherefore, not only <hi>Popes,</hi> but what≈øoever Apo≈øtles or Angels attempting that, ≈øhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr the cur≈øe and indignation of God. And this point is al≈øo free from controver≈øie.</p>
            <p>The third is controver≈øial, and examines whether or no the pre≈øent <hi>Church of Rome</hi> lieth under this heavy cur≈øe, for impo≈øing upon the people of Chri≈øt a <hi>P≈øeudo-evangelium, an adulterate Go≈øpel,</hi> which is not of Chri≈øt. I ≈øhall as briefly and clearly as time will permit, di≈øcover the Adulterate Go≈øpel of <hi>Rome,</hi> both to ju≈øtifie my de≈øertion thereof, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> if it be po≈ø≈øible, to ≈øtir up my Roman Brethren to a ju≈øt emulation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ≈øubdivide this third point into three re≈øolves.</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt I will ≈øhew, what was that Go≈øpel which Chri≈øt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles preached as the only and immutable way of eternal truth and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52857:4"/>In the ≈øecond I will ≈øhew that the pre≈øent Church of <hi>England</hi> profe≈ø≈øeth and maintaineth the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>In the third I will ≈øhew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preacheth and impo≈øeth a contrary Go≈øpel, and con≈øequently lieth under the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Spirit expre≈øt in the Text.</p>
            <p>To re≈øolve the fir≈øt, to wit, what was that Go≈øpel which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles preached, the u≈øual way of the mo≈øt learned Doctors is to ≈øhew that the written Word of God, is the only Word of God extant on Earth: and con≈øequently the Go≈øpel which Chri≈øt preached, and his Apo≈øtles after him, is that doctrine only which is contained in that written Word. And then ≈øeeing that the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øt in the written Word: but the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> doctrine is neither contained there, nor deducible thence; It follows that the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Go≈øpel preached by Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles; but the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Go≈øpel is another, and accur≈øed by the Spirit in our Text.</p>
            <p>But this manner of proof I will not now follow for three re≈øpects. 1. It is more tedious than our pre≈øent purpo≈øe can ≈øpare time. 2. It is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty in Demon≈øtration than many capacities can bear and gain by. 3. Its demon≈øtration would not re≈øolve our que≈øtion ≈øo home as is requi≈øite. For although it were demon≈øtrated that the written Word is the only Word of God; yet would there ≈øtill remain a que≈øtion, what part of that written Word is that Go≈øpel which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles preached, as the <gap reason="foreign">

promi≈øed. For what Sermon of Chri≈øt is there? what Di≈øcour≈øe? what Parable? what Sentence or An≈øwer? yea, what Page, or almo≈øt Ver≈øe is there in the whole New Te≈øtament, which doth not ≈øufficiently proclaim, that, Who≈øoever believeth in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and ob≈øerveth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is heir of his Kingdom? This therefore, according to the legal Proclamation of Chri≈øt, is true Chri≈øtian repentance, the Go≈øpel of the Kingdom, the nece≈ø≈øary and only way of Salvation, which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles preached; to wit, to believe Je≈øus to be the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and to keep his Commandments. Thus the parts of Repentance are two, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity, Belief</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> The≈øe con≈øummate the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the perfect cure and reparation of man. Wherefore Chri≈øt, when≈øoever he ≈øolemnly acted the Phy≈øitian of the whole Man, of Body and Soul, you'l find, that to believe in his God-head and ≈øin no more, was the beginning and end of the whole cure. <hi>Do≈øt thou believe?</hi> was the Therapeutick part; <hi>Sin no more,</hi> was the prophylactick. Yea, the fir≈øt was the de≈øign and inference of all his works; the other, of all his words. For all his wonderful deeds were to per≈øwade men <hi>Faith,</hi> that he was the Son of God: and all his admirable Sermons were to per≈øwade men <hi>Charity,</hi> that is, to keep the Commandments.</p>
            <p>But here we are to ob≈øerve how the≈øe two parts of Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance mutually include or infer one another. To believe Je≈øus to be the Son of God is the ≈øum of <hi>Faith,</hi> and this, if real and ≈øolid, certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth charity, which is the fulfilling of the Commandments. And therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. it is ≈øaid, <hi>Faith in Chri≈øt worketh by love.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Charity the end of the Commandment,</hi> is put the off-≈øpring <hi>of Faith unfeigned.</hi> Thus true Faith infers Charity, as the Sun u≈øhers in light. Wherefore <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ≈øaid well, <hi>Quantum credimus, tantum dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus; As much as we believe, ≈øo much we love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ≈øide, Charity nece≈ø≈øarily includes or pre≈øuppo≈øeth Faith. For the fir≈øt Commandment, and con≈øequently the fir≈øt object of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is <hi>to believe</hi> in God; that is, to have no other Gods be≈øide the true God, which is Je≈øus, with the Father, and Holy Gho≈øt. And 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.23. <hi>We have confidence towards God becau≈øe we keep his commandments. And this is his commandment, that we ≈øhould believe on the name of his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> And the Apo≈øtle <hi>James</hi> bids us <hi>≈øhew our faith by our works, for faith without works is dead;</hi> that is, is fal≈øe, adulterate and feigned: for ≈øuch men <hi>≈øay</hi> they have <hi>faith,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>boa≈øt</hi> to <hi>live;</hi> but the unity of their <hi>works</hi> declares the <hi>fiction</hi> of their <hi>hearts. Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.3. What then? mu≈øt

he that hath Faith to ju≈øtification and ≈øalvation have no ≈øin, as the <hi>Romi≈øts</hi> attribute to their <hi>Prie≈øtly ab≈øolutions</hi> and <hi>Papal indulgences?</hi> No, For <hi>if we ≈øay we have no ≈øin, the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. How then do we keep the Commandments? it follows immediately, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>If we confe≈øs our ≈øins, he is faithful and ju≈øt to forgive us our ≈øins;</hi> to wit, if we have an unfeigned Faith <hi>in his name,</hi> which will certainly through love, work a ≈øorrow to offend <hi>him, who is the propitiation for our ≈øins, and not for ours only, but al≈øo for the ≈øins of the whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. Thus it appears that to believe unfeignedly in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are two things in≈øeparable. Wherefore when≈øoever we hear eternal life and ≈øalvation promi≈øed to the one, the other mu≈øt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood included, as a nece≈ø≈øary part of that Repentance, to which Chri≈øt hath promi≈øed his Kingdom. The mutual relation of the≈øe parts being thus ob≈øerved we are to con≈øider them di≈øtinctly by them≈øelves. And, fir≈øt,</p>
            <p>The Holy Scripture every where proclaims, That To believe Je≈øus to be the Son of God, is an ab≈øolute ≈øum of all nece≈ø≈øary Faith: yea, I dare ≈øay, This is the way of Salvation, the Repentance to which the Kingdom is promi≈øed, and the whole Primitive Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt in the ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe and propriety of that word, as we explicated before. And Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf is my Warrant, Author, and Argument, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ≈øent.</hi> And le≈øt we might interpret this in too narrow a ≈øen≈øe, Chri≈øt would be his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>This is the will of him that ≈øent me, that every one which believeth on the Son, may have everla≈øting life, and I will rai≈øe him up a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

with all confidence, relie on the mo≈øt warrantable Word of Chri≈øts own oral promi≈øe, which is ≈øo far from needing the confirmation of a <hi>Papal Bull,</hi> that Apo≈øtles or Angels preaching any other Go≈øpel, are declared accur≈øed. Yet,</p>
            <p>It will not be ami≈øs to ≈øee how con≈øonant the Proclamation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles is to the Archetypal Word of their Ma≈øter, to the Primitive and Oral Law of their Lord. The mo≈øt beloved Di≈øciple of Je≈øus, <hi>John</hi> is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable Recorder, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.31. He bears record that <hi>the Go≈øpels were written that we might believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name.</hi> His Epi≈øtles are decretal in this point. 1 Jo. 5.3. he formally profe≈ø≈øeth his de≈øign, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I write to that end that ye may know that ye have eternal life if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of the Son of God.</hi> Farther, the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, as appears in the Book of their Acts, was to baptize in the name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; that is, to make members of the Church ≈øuch as had no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of Faith than to believe Je≈øus to be the Chri≈øt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man add <hi>to the word of Faith,</hi> but rather con≈øent with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>This is the word of faith which we preach. If thou confe≈ø≈øe≈øt with thy mouth our Lord Je≈øus, and in thy heart believe≈øt, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Faith in Chri≈øt includes, or infers (as we ≈øaid) Charity, <hi>which is the fulfilling of the Law, to do to others, even as we would they ≈øhould do to us,</hi> Mat. 7.12. <hi>The whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ≈øhalt love thy neighbour as thy ≈øelf,</hi> Gal. 5.14. <hi>If we love one another, God abideth in us, and the love of God is perfected in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.12. This Belief and Love combined in one, mo≈øt amply expre≈øs that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles preached, to which they promi≈øed the Kingdom. So we find them jointly expre≈øt, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and that we love one another.</hi> This is his Commandment both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <p>We therefore briefly and clearly conclude our fir≈øt Re≈øolve; to wit, that the Go≈øpel which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles preached, as the only and immutable way of eternal truth and happine≈øs, con≈øi≈øts in the Faith and Love which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; that is, to believe Je≈øus to be the Son of God, and to keep his Commandments, and is e≈ø≈øentially neither more nor le≈øs: For, as <hi>the whole law is fulfilled in one word, Thou ≈øhalt love thy neighbour as thy ≈øelf,</hi> Gal. 5.14.

            <p>The Sixth makes a full profe≈ø≈øion of the Sacrifice of the Ma≈øs and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øub≈øtantiation.</p>
            <p>The Seventh profe≈ø≈øeth the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected under the ≈øign of Bread alone.</p>
            <p>The Eighth holds Purgatory, as a Territory ≈øubject to the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Ninth holds the Adoration and Wor≈øhip of Saints and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</p>
            <p>The Tenth holds Image-Wor≈øhip.</p>
            <p>The Eleventh holds Pardons, Graces of the Pope, and Indulgences, as mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary in≈øtruments of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth profe≈ø≈øeth the pre≈øent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Only, Holy, Catholick and Apo≈øtolick Church, Mother and Mi≈øtre≈øs of all other Churches, and voweth unlimited Obedience to the Pope, as Head thereof.</p>
            <p>The Thirteenth univer≈øally and undoubtedly receives and profe≈ø≈øeth all the Decrees and Declarations of Roman Canons and Councils; but <hi>above all,</hi> (to wit, even the four Primitive Councils) what≈øoever is delivered, defined, or declared in the <hi>holy and ≈øacred Synod of Trent,</hi> and rejecteth all things contrary; to wit, <hi>even the Scripture it ≈øelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourteenth recollecteth all the fore≈øaid Articles, and ≈øolemnly promi≈øeth, voweth and ≈øweareth to maintain and teach them, not as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace, of Obedience, of Conformity or Legal Doctrine, but, as <hi>the true Catholick Faith, without which no man can be ≈øaved.</hi> Which is the character and e≈ø≈øential property of the Go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt (even in that ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe we before explicated) u≈øurpt by this Schola≈øtick Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue

of <hi>Trent</hi> to my≈øterize and gild Iniquity. This is the ≈øum of that Go≈øpel which the pre≈øent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains; and ≈øo from the beginning of my Di≈øcour≈øe hitherto</p>
            <p>I have laid open both Go≈øpels, fir≈øt, that of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which con≈øi≈øts in believing in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and in keeping his Commandments: then, That of Chri≈øts pretended Vicair the Pope; which con≈øi≈øts totally in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Popes Definitions, and in obeying his Precepts. He that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth not the contradiction and repugnancy of the≈øe two Go≈øpels, mu≈øt needs forfeit the e≈øteem of a rea≈øonable man, as well as of a right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled Chri≈øtian. Behold their difference from bottom to top.</p>
            <p>The foundation of the one is Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which was laid from the beginning, and <hi>another foundation can no man lay,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. The foundation of the other is Papal Supremacy, which was not from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but laid by man is to be rai≈øed by man. The holy Spirit build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the faithful on the fir≈øt foundation by hope in the grace and merits of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. The Pope builds his credulous children on his own foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, by hope in the grace and merits of his Pardons and Indulgences. The charity of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which is <hi>to love one another as he loved us,</hi> is the furniture and perfection of the fir≈øt building; but ≈ølavery and bondage to Papal juri≈ødiction is the top and con≈øummation of the Roman Edifice. <hi>Recit√¢≈ø≈øe confut√¢≈ø≈øe e≈øt.</hi> The bare rehear≈øal of ≈øuch a Creed is a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its heterodox ab≈øurdity.</p>

            <p>As for <hi>Primitive Creeds:</hi> The whole Chri≈øtian World ever held, yea, the pre≈øent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in word, though not in effect, holdeth, that the Apo≈øtles Creed was by them in the H.

            <p>The Primitive Councils are four, of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus,</hi> and of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> In the≈øe the whole Chri≈øtian World, <hi>on which as yet the dew of the doctrine of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles ≈øtood fre≈øh and fair,</hi> unanimou≈øly made a Catholick, united, and mo≈øt ≈øolemn atte≈øtation of the Faith of Chri≈øt.

grounded on the Cathedral word of a Pope; not as the old Creed, a ≈øum of the work of the Scriptures, written by the in≈øtinct, and confirmed by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of the Holy Spirit; but a ≈øum of the work on Earth, to wit, of the Canon law of <hi>Rome,</hi> written by the in≈øtinct, and confirmed by the mo≈øt mighty Bulls of the mo≈øt Holy Fathers the Bi≈øhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which ≈øum his ≈øaid <hi>Mo≈øt Holy Paternity</hi> defines to be the <hi>true Catholick Faith, without which no man can be ≈øaved:</hi> which Definition who≈øoever infringeth, he ≈øhall not only incur <hi>his Holine≈øs</hi> di≈øplea≈øure, but <hi>the indignation</hi> al≈øo (<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret ei Deus,</hi> God rebuke him) <hi>of Almighty God.</hi> And the rebuke will quickly follow, if you plea≈øe to con≈øider four <hi>Primary Texts of Scripture.</hi>

            <p>Acts 15.28. <hi>It is approved of the Holy Gho≈øt and us</hi> [≈øay the Apo≈øtles at <hi>Jeru≈øalem] not to impo≈øe on you a greater burthen than the≈øe nece≈ø≈øary things.</hi> Hath the Holy Gho≈øt, in length of years, di≈øapproved in <hi>Trent</hi> what he approved in <hi>Jeru≈øalem?</hi> to double the burden of belief and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?

            <p>The Apo≈øtle <hi>Jude</hi> in his Catholick Epi≈øtle, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>thinks it nece≈ø≈øary to exhort us to contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> But Pope <hi>Pius</hi> commands us to fight for the Faith now of late <hi>in≈øpired into the holy Fathers of the Council of Trent, initio Bullae.</hi> But let us obey the holy Apo≈øtle, who like a Me≈ø≈øenger of God, exhorts us with a ≈øalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Mercy, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> But let us avoid the Papal Spirit as of a contrary Satanical mi≈ø≈øion; for, more <hi>Impious</hi> indeed than <hi>Pius</hi> by name, he u≈øurps a threat of the Indignation of God, and as if that were not enough to fill his bla≈øphemous throat, he adds a double one of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> implying his own as the root of his bitterne≈øs.</p>

But as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are certainly the Catholick Te≈øtament of Chri≈øt, and the Creed an Apo≈øtolical Legacy of Faith: So what≈øoever Church maintains the≈øe, as at this day Our Church of <hi>England,</hi> is truly Catholick and Apo≈øtolical.</p>
            <p>Now rejoyce, thou Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt!

            <p>To conclude, Take a ≈øhort Corollary or Recapitulation of all that hath been ≈øaid. Fir≈øt it hath on one ≈øide been manife≈øtly evidenced from the Word of God, that the Go≈øpel of the Kingdom, that is, <hi>the Repentance to which Chri≈øt promi≈øed his Kingdom,</hi> is to believe and love, to believe in the Saviour Je≈øus and to keep his Commandments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, on the other ≈øide, it hath been manife≈øtly evidenced from the ≈øolemn profe≈ø≈øion of Faith in the pre≈øent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> canonized by Pope <hi>Pius Quartus,</hi> that ≈øhe impo≈øeth as nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation, a far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier burden than that Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt; to wit, the Creed or Go≈øpel of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is evident in our Text, that it is not in the power of Apo≈øtle or Angel, much le≈øs of a Pope, to impo≈øe another Go≈øpel than that of Chri≈øt. And then in fine,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it mu≈øt needs be evident, that who≈øoever is ≈øo much a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian as to believe the Scriptures, and ≈øo much a rea≈øonable Man, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh between one Go≈øpel and another, mu≈øt needs acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to preach another Go≈øpel than that of Chri≈øt: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently, if he loves and hopes eternal life, will de≈øert that Church which leaves the paths of the Go≈øpel of life, and ≈øeek to be Member of ≈øuch a Chri≈øtian body as adheres to its head Je≈øus Chri≈øt, by a ≈øincere adhe≈øion to his ≈øaving Go≈øpel. Such is the Evangelical, Apo≈øtolical and Catholick Church of <hi>England:</hi> in which God maintain and increa≈øe the Faith and Love which is in his Son Chri≈øt Je≈øus through his Holy Spirit. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Profe≈ø≈øion of Faith is truly that <hi>form of Godline≈øs,</hi> of which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. which the Papal Church profe≈ø≈øeth, <hi>yet really denieth the power thereof;</hi> as the≈øe following Stars make clearly appear. For fir≈øt,</p>
            <p n="1">(* 1) Here is a ≈øolemn celebrity of a form of Profe≈ø≈øion of the Orthodox Faith of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Yet weigh the matter contained, and it proves nothing el≈øe in fine but a vow of unlimited obedience to the Pope, and of a Faith totally captivated to his Councils, Canons, and Decrees: as mo≈øt ≈øpecially appears in the 12. 13. and 14. Articles of the New Creeed.</p>
            <p n="2">(* 2) Here is a form of the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Humility imaginable, where the Bi≈øhop of Bi≈øhops terms him≈øelf the Servant of the Servants of God: but con≈øider a Satanical pride, or a greater if po≈ø≈øible, wherewith he exalts him≈øelf above all that is called God, glorying in the title of the <hi>Mo≈øt Holy Lord,</hi> which he prints above in Capital Letters, and maintains in tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling on the heads of Kings and Emperours, by u≈øurpt ≈øupremacy.</p>
            <p n="3">(* 3) Here is an extern form of Divine Doctrine, which is pretended to be in≈øpired by God into the Holy Fathers congregated in his name. But the real truth is, that the≈øe Fathers were Schoolmen, more famous for knowledge in the Canon-law of <hi>Rome,</hi> than for holy life in the law of God; in≈øpired with the Spirit of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and other School-Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øts, more than with the Spirit of their Ma≈øter Chri≈øt, as appears in their long New Creed drawn from their Schools and not from the Go≈øpel: Congregated, not in the name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> for then his Law would have been their Rule: but in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who≈øe Kingdom they have ≈øought for as mo≈øt faithful Va≈ø≈øals.</p>
            <p n="4">(* 4) Here is an illu≈øtrious form of Catholick and Apo≈øtolical Belief; to wit, a ≈øolemn Profe≈ø≈øion of the Primitive Creed of the Apo≈øtles, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrated by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> as a ju≈øt ≈øum of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52857:17"/>
Faith of Chri≈øt. But this ≈øame Faith is my≈øteriou≈øly ≈øubverted by a New Creed of Traditions immediately added, exceeding the former in <hi>number</hi> of Articles, in <hi>weight</hi> of difficulty, and in <hi>mea≈øure</hi> unlimited of School-A≈ø≈øertions.</p>
            <p n="5">(* 5) Under the form of the≈øe words, <hi>Apo≈øtolical, Eccle≈øia≈øtical, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Holy, Church, Mother, &amp;c.</hi> lies always hid the adulterate matter of the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Synagogue.</p>
            <p n="6">(* 6) Here is a form of receiving the Scripture, but in truth they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it only in ≈øuch tenour and ≈øen≈øe as the Fathers admit; that is, the School-men approved by the Pope. For although this Article craftily ≈øeems to mean the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, yet truly they are admitted no more than the Pope and his School-men are plea≈øed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and what is really here meant by the Mother-Church, you may ≈øee plainly in <hi>Art.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="7">(* 7) This ≈øeems a ≈øhort Article in form, but in matter it is greater than a ju≈øt Creed: for the things declared and defined by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> concerning Original ≈øin and Ju≈øtification, are many and weighty.</p>
            <p n="8">(* 8) This and the following Articles of this New Creed are very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious by a diminutive form of expre≈ø≈øion which craftily hideth a matter of greater Moment. As here the ≈øouls in Purgatory are only ≈øaid to be holpen by the Suffrages of the Faithful. Yet certain it is, that the Pope lays claim to a greater power in that infernal Territory, and boa≈øteth to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the Keys thereof, and to open and ≈øhut at plea≈øure: e≈øpecially to ≈øuch as are liberal in Alms.</p>
            <p n="9">(* 9) Here is al≈øo a diminution of words: For indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> tenet is, <hi>That the Saints are to be adored and wor≈øhiped for this cau≈øe chiefly;</hi> to wit, <hi>becau≈øe Salvation, and other divine benefits are obtained by their Merits and Grace;</hi> as the Catechi≈øm of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øeth, <hi>Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Num.</hi> XXIV. Whence is manife≈øt that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes the Saints fellow-Saviours with Chri≈øt: for Chri≈øt is not a Saviour any other way than by procuring us ≈øalvation and other benefits by his merits and grace.</p>
            <p n="10">(* 10) Here is al≈øo a diminutive expre≈ø≈øion: For the Pope u≈øurpeth Indulgences not only as conducing to ≈øalvation, but truly as fully ≈øufficient to ≈øave all tho≈øe that receive them; for to ≈øuch he promi≈øeth infallible forgivene≈øs of all ≈øin, and pain due to ≈øin, e≈øpecially if the Indulgence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a condition of giving Alms.</p>
            <p n="11">(* 11) This Twelfth Article is both diminutive in expre≈ø≈øion, and captious in con≈øequence. For, fir≈øt, it means that all the Churches and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52857:17"/>
Nations of the World are ≈øubject to the Laws and Canons of <hi>Rome.</hi> A thing which neither Scripture nor Rea≈øon, nor any Chri≈øtian Principle can ≈øu≈øtain. Secondly, It would infer, That the Pope, as Vicar of Chri≈øt, is Lord and Ma≈øter of the Nations of the World, and can di≈øpo≈øe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Crowns, and Diadems, when and how he ≈øhall at any time define.</p>
            <p n="12">(* 12) By this appears that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is the only mea≈øure and rule of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in≈øtructeth the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Gal.</hi> 1.8. to mea≈øure their Faith by that Go≈øpel only, which from the beginning they had received, and was by him≈øelf preached unto them. And indeed this long New Creed of <hi>Rome</hi> is not derived in the lea≈øt from Canonical Scripture; but in whole and in part from the Canons of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">(* 13) <hi>Without which no man can be ≈øaved.</hi> This evidently ≈øheweth, That this Profe≈ø≈øion of Faith is not made as a means of uniformity only, as are the Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> but as a New Creed, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, or Rule of E≈ø≈øential belief, and as ≈øuch is here impo≈øed by the Pope upon his Subjects to be profe≈ø≈øed, vowed, ≈øworn, and maintained under pain of eternal damnation.</p>
            <p n="14">(* 14) By this direful Cur≈øe of the Pope, ≈øo confidently ca≈øt on tho≈øe that reject his New Creed and <hi>Trent-Go≈øpel,</hi> appears, how contrary the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Spirit is to the Spirit that ≈øpake in <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.8. where a Cur≈øe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to fall on tho≈øe who ≈øhall preach a Go≈øpel other than that which was already preached by <hi>Paul.</hi> The Cur≈øe therefore, except we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly deny the Holy Gho≈øt in his great Apo≈øtle, mu≈øt fall on the Pope and and Papal Preachers; except they can find a Priviledge, greater than gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Apo≈øtles, or Angels, to preach and e≈øtabli≈øh New Go≈øpels at plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>Wherefore no man, ≈øo much a Chri≈øtian as to believe the Scriptures, can in Con≈øcience make ≈øcruple to reject this Papal Symbol, as Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with its Author: Otherwi≈øe, as captive to accur≈øed Doctors, let ≈øuch an one certainly expect to be led in darkne≈øs, deprived of the Truth and Light of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>In fine, It appears, That as the ≈øum of the Primitive Creed and Go≈øpel is to believe <hi>in God;</hi> ≈øo the ≈øum of the Romi≈øh Creed and Go≈øpel is to believe <hi>in Man, the Pope.</hi> And as the Rule of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Faith is <hi>the Word of God, the holy Scriptures;</hi> ≈øo the Rule of the Romi≈øh Faith is <hi>the word of Man, Papal definitions.</hi> And as the end
